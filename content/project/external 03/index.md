title: Developing ERGM models for Social Networks
summary: Developing Exponentially Random Graph Models for Social Network Analysis. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) serve as a powerful tool for Social Network Analysis (SNA). These models are employed to understand and interpret the complex patterns of relationships within social networks. ERGMs go beyond simple descriptive statistics, allowing researchers to statistically model the likelihood of observed network structures.
