title: Network Stochastic Processes and Time Series (NeST)
summary: In this research, we closely explore the Hawkes Network Stochastic Processes and Time Series (NeST), a method for understanding how events depend on each other. Over the past 50 years, we've seen different versions of this process. We aim to create a single, easy-to-use solution for 12 variations. By doing this, we hope to make it simpler for everyone to study and predict how things relate in various fields, all while building on the decades-long history of Hawkes models. We introduce a practical solution by using a general Bayesina approach.

The application of point processes for information cascade prediction in social networks involves modeling the temporal dynamics of information propagation. Point processes, such as Hawkes processes, capture the self-exciting nature of events and inter-event dependencies. By analyzing past cascades, these models predict future information diffusion patterns, aiding in understanding and managing viral content spread in dynamic social network environments. This approach contributes valuable insights to fields like marketing, epidemiology, and online influence dynamics.
