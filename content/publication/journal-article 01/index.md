abstract: This study addresses the supplier selection problem in a complex supply chain context using a multi-objective model with fuzzy parameters. The model incorporates multiple periods, resources, products, and a two-echelon supply chain. Objective functions include total purchase costs, transportation, order and on-time delivery, coverage, and supplier weights. The proposed fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method determines supplier weights, while triangular fuzzy numbers handle delay-related parameters. The study introduces a novel aspect by considering both partial and general coverage of suppliers, enhancing realism in product orders.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
