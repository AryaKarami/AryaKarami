abstract: Social networks play a crucial role in shaping community events like Parkrun, influencing organization and participation. To ensure the success of Parkrun events, effective monitoring is essential. This paper suggests using the Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) chart for social network monitoring. Applying this approach to UK Parkrun events data reveals valuable insights into participant sentiments and preferences, aiding event planners in making informed decisions about logistics, resource allocation, and safety measures. By tracking participants' choices, this research highlights the significant impact on event coordination and participant satisfaction, emphasizing the practicality of monitoring methods in improving event management.
